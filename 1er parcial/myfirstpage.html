    <h1 style="color: brown;">VM PROJECT ARCHITECTURE: <q>WHAT MAKES THEIR MVS SO GROUNDBREAKING?</q></h1>
    <h4><u><b>VM ARCHITECTURE</b>are a Seoul(kr) based production company imaging music and vice versa.</u></h4>
    <p>VM Project has directed many notable music videos in the K-Pop scene, and continue to expand their reach from labels such as SM and YG. 
        Starting off as a commercial production team they began working in-house for SM and YG sometime in 2014. 
        Their first noticeable contribution to SM’s music video style was f(x)’s “Red Light”. At the time, this music video gained attention 
        from fans for breaking some of SM’s rules – mainly that of the “box”, which consists of a built set inside a studio – and would cement 
        some of the key aspects of their style.</p>

    <h2 style="color: brown;"><blockquote>-Aesthetic</blockquote></h2>
    <p>VM Project’s style has a distinctive look, but one that has many facets that aren’t present in every music video. For instance, the CGI used in BlackPink’s <i>“Whistle”</i> can’t be seen in Seventeen’s <i>“Don’t Wanna Cry”</i>, and as such it’s hard to pinpoint exactly what makes their music videos so easy to notice as their unique work. 
        Fortunately, there are enough recurring stylistic choices that, when pulled together, give away the source of the production. Often VM Project will use single shots of inanimate objects being deconstructed in between scenes of the idols in order to create pace, energy, or a feeling of danger. Or, use panning and dollying of shots to create motion and exploration of space as well as these qualities.</p>

    <h2 style="color: brown;"><blockquote>-Lighting</blockquote></h2>
    <p>As for their lighting, the scenes often vary, but a few things remain consistent: there’s <mark>contrasts, filters, and dimension.</mark> On sets there are many different ways you can light the studio or setting, but often the way it is done involves three main type of lights: backlight, low (or high) light, and fill light. The backlight ensures the background of the shot is lit, the low/highlight describes how the lighting creates contrasts, and the fill light eliminate the shadows that are missed in the previous two light setups.</p>
